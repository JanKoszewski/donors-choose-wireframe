Donors Team 6
=============

### Who's it for

  ##### Potential Characters:

    * Teacher's friend group: give a concentrated way for these types
of people to contribute to smaller projects

    * PTA/community members: Provide actionable steps for small groups
to attack fundraising

    * Students/faculty members? A more public platform for these people
to interact with their potential donors


### What does it attack

  * Problem: Giving to DC can feel like an isolated/individual
experience, yet the projects have very community-oriented impact
  * These are the types of projects that groups of people are likely to
care about, but there is not much interface for them to share their
interest or contributions
  * Provide a public facing interface for people to track their
contributions toward raising money for DC projects

### How does it attack it

  * Give basic tasks and advice to guide contributions

  * Track exploits and contributions as means of encouragement

  * Give a mechanism to convert user actions into fundraising
(challenges, "points" system, sweat equity)

### Expected results

  * Focused activity on selected projects
  * Projects that get attention from a team should raise $$ faster than
those that just sit around

### Action step

  * Adopt a project via the site.

  * Assemble your squad

  * Potential integration with the "donors select" group for picking
projects after filtering.
